<!-- thought to be a early dev version for rapid prototyping. 

	This file allows to rapid prototype ideas by allowing the user
	to recompile a shader and relink variables, or even add new variables.
	
	At later version might be an effect where multiple render programs can be 
	used and blending properties can be set.

			NOTE: At the moment, not implemented, because its 
				usability is not certain. I think the regual use case
				is to set the variables from code.
